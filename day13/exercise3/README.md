<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Read this the code in main.py</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Spot the problems üêû.</li>
    <li>Modify the code to fix the program.</li>
    <li>No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.</li>
    <li>The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.</li>
    <li>Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".</p>
<p>When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".</p>
<p>And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"</p>
